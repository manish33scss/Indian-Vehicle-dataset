# Indian-Vehicle-dataset

Indian Vehicle dataset, this dataset is created for my thesis topic : "Intelligent Traffic Management System" for drawing analysis over Indian traffic in a much comprehensive manner.
Data is collected from cameras mounted on traffic lights of Noida, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.
More than 3000 annotated images are present, where classes include, 
Car, Autorickshaw, Person, ElectricRickshaw, Truck, Motorcycle, Bus and RiderNoHelmet. 


With this I've also uploaded a weight file for you guys to start from. 

These are annotated using "LableIMG" , in .txt format.
